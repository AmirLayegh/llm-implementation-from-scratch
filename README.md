# ðŸ“š Build a Large Language Model From Scratch - Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of concepts and models from the book ["Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

## About

This project follows the step-by-step guide from Sebastian Raschka's book to build a GPT-style language model from the ground up. The implementation includes creating, training, and fine-tuning a large language model that can run on a standard laptop.

## Book Overview

The book covers:
- Planning and coding all parts of an LLM
- Preparing datasets for LLM training
- Fine-tuning LLMs for text classification
- Using human feedback for instruction following
- Loading pretrained weights into an LLM
